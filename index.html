This is designed to help them not only in  learning basic computer skills but also become  empowered to participate in the process of digitalisation of education and knowledge which our society is presently witnessing. It will also enable the trainees to prepare for  better employability  as and when they reach the age of productive service.</p>

											<p><b>Rotary-Bosch Bridge Programme for digital literacy and better employability</b> A Rotary Bosch Bridge skilling Centre has been set up by the Awareness Foundation at Urvashi, Mallickpur.

											<h3>Building knowledge support network</h3>
