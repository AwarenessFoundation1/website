									<h2>Empowering Women Through Skill Development</h2>

									<h3>Foundational Training in Stitching & Tailoring</h3>
									<p>In 2018, the Awareness Foundation launched its first skill training program in collaboration with <strong>Naba Niharika, Kolkata</strong>, an NGO working for women’s empowerment. This initiative provided basic training in cutting, stitching, and tailoring for women from economically weaker sections in Mallickpur, South 24 Parganas.</p>

									<h3>Impact So Far</h3>
									<ul>
										<li><strong>150+ women trained</strong> in stitching, dress cutting, and embroidery across multiple villages.</li>
										<li>Training covered <strong>sewing machine operations, pattern cutting, and stitching techniques.</strong></li>
										<li>Post-training <strong>examinations conducted by Shramik Vidyapeeth</strong>, a recognized body of the Government of West Bengal.</li>
									</ul>

									<h3>Transforming Lives</h3>
									<p>Most trainees come from <strong>BPL and economically weaker backgrounds</strong>, with education up to the secondary level. Their goal: to gain skills for self-reliance and home-based entrepreneurship.</p>
									<p>Many have successfully taken steps towards financial independence, investing in their own sewing machines and starting small businesses from home. The training has added <strong>substantial value to their skillset</strong>, enabling them to contribute to household incomes.</p>

									<h3>Advanced Training in Garment & Dress Designing</h3>
									<p>Responding to demand, an <strong>Advanced Garment and Dress Designing Program</strong> was introduced in <strong>September 2024</strong>, providing a six-month upskilling course for women who had completed basic training. The first batch is currently undergoing training, learning higher-level garment construction techniques.</p>

									<h3>Expanding Opportunities: Corporate Partnerships</h3>

									<h4>Rotary-Singer Partnership for Advanced Training</h4>
									<p>The initiative has scaled up through <strong>corporate social responsibility (CSR) partnerships</strong>, securing recognition from <strong>Singer India</strong> and <strong>Rotary Club Calcutta (Pointers).</strong></p>
									<ul>
										<li>A tripartite <strong>Memorandum of Understanding (MoU)</strong> was signed on <strong>December 20, 2024</strong>, marking the launch of a new skill development initiative.</li>
										<li>On <strong>January 13, 2025</strong>, the <strong>Singer-Supported Training Centre</strong> was inaugurated at the Awareness Foundation’s Sewing Centre in Mallickpur.</li>
										<li>Under <strong>Project 'Swabolombi'</strong>, trainees will receive comprehensive skill training, equipping them to become independent entrepreneurs.</li>
									</ul>

									<h3>Looking Ahead</h3>
									<p>The program continues to <strong>evolve and expand</strong>, creating more opportunities for rural women to achieve financial independence and contribute to their communities. With strong partnerships and dedicated efforts, the Awareness Foundation remains committed to sustainable skill development and economic empowerment.</p>
