										<h1>About Us</h1>

											</ul>

										<h2>Our Approach</h2>
										<ul>
											<li><strong>Skill Development:</strong> Bridging skill gaps through tailored training programs for youth and women in rural areas.</li>
											<li><strong>Entrepreneurial Growth:</strong> Fostering self-reliance by equipping individuals with skills to create and sustain businesses.</li>
											<li><strong>Market Integration:</strong> Connecting trained individuals with industry opportunities to ensure long-term economic success.</li>
											<li><strong>Community-Centered Learning:</strong> Customizing training to align with local needs, industry demands, and evolving job markets.</li>
										</ul>

										<h3>Why It Matters</h3>
										<p>With 65% of India’s youth in the working-age group, the demand for diverse skill sets is growing. The Awareness Foundation aligns with the <strong>Skill India Mission</strong> to empower individuals and integrate them into the modern workforce. Our grassroots approach ensures a focus on smaller towns, particularly in West Bengal, where economic inclusion is most needed.</p>

										<h3>Our Impact</h3>
										<ul>
											<li>Established in 2015 to create a socially inclusive and skilled workforce.</li>
											<li>Focused on youth and women in rural communities to promote economic independence.</li>
											<li>Blending high-quality education, hands-on training, and market linkages to enhance employability.</li>
										</ul>

										<h3>Addressing the Informal Workforce</h3>
										<p>In India, nine out of ten workers are employed in the informal sector, yet they contribute significantly to the nation’s GDP. This highlights the need for structured skill development programs that promote the <strong>dignity of labor</strong> and ensure inclusion in high-value industries. Our approach integrates vocational training with real-world applications, paving the way for a stronger, more self-reliant workforce.</p>
