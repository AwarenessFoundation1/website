									<p>The Awareness Foundation actively convenes <strong>stakeholder meetings, workshops, and discussions</strong> to exchange experiences and deliberate on skill building, livelihood enhancement, and employability. A key initiative has been developing a <strong>resource network</strong> to enrich training curricula, expand outreach, and strengthen knowledge support for skill-building programs.</p>

									<h3>Genesis of the Initiative</h3>

									<p>In <strong>2017</strong>, the foundation launched this effort with an <strong>expert roundtable workshop</strong> at its site office, gathering specialists from various domains, including:</p>

									<ul>
										<li>Ecology</li>
										<li>Social work and skill training</li>
										<li>Banking and finance</li>
										<li>Statistics and quality control</li>
										<li>Economics and geography</li>
									</ul>

									<p>This workshop laid the foundation for <strong>skill mapping</strong> in the local region, leading to:</p>

									<ul>
										<li>Development of <strong>short-term training courses</strong> aligned with local needs.</li>
										<li>Collaboration with <strong>local institutions</strong> for training and skill development.</li>
										<li>Establishment of a <strong>framework for skill-building, social enterprises, and self-employment</strong>.</li>
									</ul>

									<h3>Rural Executive Development Programme</h3>

									<p>In <strong>January 2017</strong>, the Awareness Foundation partnered with the <strong>Central Bank of India</strong> to organize a <strong>Rural Executive Development Programme</strong> titled <em>“Essentials of Doing Business.”</em> Held at the Mallickpur site office in 24 Parganas South District, this initiative mobilized <strong>23 rural self-employed individuals</strong> from diverse entrepreneurial backgrounds. The program saw an <strong>overwhelming response from self-employed rural women</strong>, demonstrating the strong demand for structured business guidance.</p>

									<h3>Expert Meet on Occupational Safety & Health</h3>

									<p>Continuing its knowledge-building efforts, the Awareness Foundation hosted an <strong>Expert Meet on Occupational Safety & Health</strong> on <strong>November 23, 2024</strong>, at an offsite location in </strong>Kalyani, Nadia</strong>. The objective was to explore the establishment of a </strong>best practices center</strong> in collaboration with civil society organizations active in the field of occupational safety.</p>
